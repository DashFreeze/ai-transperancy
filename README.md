# ðŸ§  AI Transparency: The Impact of Source Attribution on AI Credibility

This project investigates how **source attribution** affects the **perceived credibility** of generative AI responses â€” particularly in medical contexts. It aims to provide insights into user trust in AI systems and highlights the importance of **accurate citations**.

## ðŸ“„ Abstract

In this study, we explored whether the inclusion of real, fake, or no sources in AI-generated responses influences how credible people perceive the information to be. Our findings show that responses with **accurate sources** were rated as significantly more trustworthy compared to those with **fabricated sources**. No significant difference was found between responses with no sources and fake sources.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- **Participants**: 36 individuals aged 20â€“30  
- **Design**: Between-groups experiment  
- **Conditions**:
  - AI responses with accurate sources
  - AI responses with fabricated sources
  - AI responses with no sources  
- **Task**: Rate the credibility of 6 AI-generated medical answers  
- **Analysis**:
  - Quantitative: Kruskal-Wallis & Mann-Whitney U-tests
  - Qualitative: Free-text responses on credibility perception

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **Highest credibility**: Responses with real sources (Mean = 5.19)
- **Lowest credibility**: Responses with fake sources (Mean = 4.47)
- **Significant difference** between real vs. fake sources (*p = 0.0285*)
- **No significant difference** between fake and no sources

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Verifiable citations boost AI credibility.
- Fake or unverifiable references can damage user trust.
- Users value transparency and the ability to fact-check.
